🖥️ Page Replacement Algorithm Visualizer

This project is a visualization tool for simulating page replacement algorithms used in operating systems. It helps users understand how different algorithms manage memory and handle page faults.


🚀 Features:

 • 📌 Implements FIFO, LRU, and Optimal page replacement algorithms.
 • 🎨 Provides a graphical visualization of page faults and memory frame updates.
 • 🏗️ Allows users to input custom reference strings and frame sizes.
 • 📊 Compares different algorithms based on efficiency and performance.
 • 🔄 Step-by-step execution for better understanding of memory management.


🛠️ Technologies Used:

 • Python 🐍
 • Tkinter (for GUI) 🎨
 • Matplotlib (for visualization) 📊
 • GitHub for collaboration 🌍
